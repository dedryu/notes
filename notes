# The Structure of the US Government
## Reapportionment and Gerrymandering
### Districts and Miller v. Johnson
- way state legislature draws districts has frequently been criticized & subject of lawsuits. Gerrymandering doesn't just have potential to favor 1 political party over another. It can also benefit a particular racial group as well. For example, if a district has a majority of whie voters, there's high likelihood these voters will also elect someone White to represent them.
- In order to address these concerns & past instances of racial gerrymandering, several states began to create majority-minority districts. Up until its fall term of 2017, Supreme Court refused to consider cases about gerrymandered districts based on partisan reasons (i.e., districts that overwhelmingly favor Democrats or Republicans for office). However, Supreme Court has issued rulings on constitutionality of racially motivated gerrymandered districts.
- A majority-minority district is 1 in which majority of voters are of racial or ethnic minorities. These districts often elect minority representatives to Congress, but drawing of majority-minority district lines often presents legal & constitutional issues. Under 1965 Voting Rights Act, state may not draw district lines in a way that disadvantages minority voters. Creation of majority-minority districts often ensures minority voters will have choice of representation in those districts, but at expense of reducing minority votes in other districts.
- Although creating majority-minority districts has allowed more racial and ethnic minorities to be elected to Congress, it hasn't occurred w/o controversies. In addition to 1965 Voting Rights Act, Constitution’s Equal Protection Clause, found in 14th Amendment, prohibits states from drawing congressional districts based solely on race. This prohibition was upheld in Shaw v. Reno, where Supreme Court said majority-minority districts could stigmatize minority voters & send signals to representatives they're responsible for representing certain groups rather than district as a whole.
- 2 years after ruling in Shaw v. Reno, issue of majority-minority districts was subject of 1995 Supreme Court case of Miller v. Johnson. Prior to 1990, Georgia had only 1 majority-minority district (of 10 total districts), despite having population over 1/3 Black. When it was awarded additional seat in Congress after 1990 census, Georgia redistricted, creating 2 majority-minority districts. Supreme Court rejected Georgia’s redistricting, & Georgia redesigned plan to have 3 majority-minority districts. In Miller decision, Supreme Court ruled, under Constitution’s Equal Protection Clause, race couldn't be “dominant and controlling” motivation for drawing congressional districts.
- This issue was revisited in Cooper v. Harris (2017) when Supreme Court rejected electoral districts created in North Carolina because it believed state legislature had relied too heavily on race when creating its districts. As result, North Carolina had to redraw its districts to comply w/ ruling of the Court.

## 2.4 The Executive Branch
### The Design and Evolution of the Presidency
#### The Presidential Office
##### Inventing the Presidency
- presidency was proposed early in Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia by Virginia’s Edmund Randolph, as part of Virginia Plan. Madison offered a rather unclear outline of executive branch; whether what he termed the “national executive” would be an individual or group of people was undetermined.
- Madison’s lack of detail reflected the fact no one was quite sure of what a president would be. Founding Fathers wanted to avoid giving someone powers of a king, but also wanted someone w/ sufficient power to lead country in emergency. Madison proposed Congress select national executive, whose powers, authority, & length of term of service were left mostly undefined. He also proposed a “council of revision,” consisting of national executive & members of national judiciary, which would review laws passed by legislature & have power of veto.
- Early arguments reflected concerns of those who wanted a much stronger central government & of those who preferred weaker central government, like the government present under Articles of Confederation. A strong executive would provide for stronger national government. People finally agreed the executive would be a single person, elected for single term of 7 years by legislature, have power to veto legislation, & be someone legislature could impeach & remove.
- New Jersey’s William Paterson offered an alternate idea as part of his proposal, referred to as Small-State Plan or New Jersey Plan. Plan called for amending Articles of Confederation to create executive branch of a committee that would be elected by unicameral Congress for single term. Executive committee would be weak because it could be removed from power at any time if majority of state governors wanted to.
- Far more extreme was Alexander Hamilton’s suggestion that executive power be a single individual, chosen by electors, who'd serve for life & have significant power, including ability to veto legislation. President would be able to negotiate treaties, grant pardons in all cases except treason, & serve as commander in chief of armed forces.

#### Electing a President
- Debate & discussion continued thru summer of 1787. Delegates eventually settled on single executive, but they could not decide how to select that person. Pennsylvania’s James Wilson initially proposed the direct election of the president. When delegates rejected that idea, he suggested that electors, who were chosen throughout the nation, should select the executive. Over time, Wilson’s idea gained favor with delegates who were uneasy at the idea of an election by the legislature, which could lead to intrigue and corruption.
- A president elected by the legislature would also be weaker than Congress. The idea of a shorter term of service combined with eligibility for reelection also became more attractive to delegates. The framers of the Constitution struggled to find balance between giving the president the power to perform the job and giving them an opportunity to abuse power and act like a monarch.
- By early September, it had been decided that the Electoral College would select a president who would serve for four years and become eligible for reelection. Today, the Electoral College consists of 538 people called electors—each representing one of the 50 states or the District of Columbia—who formally cast votes for the election of the president and vice president.
- The Constitution lets states decide how electors are selected and how votes are cast. In 48 states and the District of Columbia, the candidate who wins the popular vote in November receives all the state’s electoral votes. These states prefer to give all their electoral votes to the winner, since doing so enhances the importance of the state in the outcome. As of 2021, two states, Nebraska and Maine, made a change to divide their electoral votes according to the district-based system; the candidate who wins the popular vote in the state gets two electoral votes, and the winner of each congressional district also receives an electoral vote.
